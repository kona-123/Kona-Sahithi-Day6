How the To-Do List App Works:
A JFrame window is created as the main app screen titled "To-Do List".

It uses a JTextField to let users type a task, and two buttons: "Add Task" and "Delete Selected".

A JList with a DefaultListModel displays the list of tasks.

When "Add Task" is clicked, the text from the input field is added to the list.

When "Delete Selected" is clicked, the selected task from the list is removed.
